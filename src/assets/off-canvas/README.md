# Off canvas starter

Use any of the included html files to start. The structure is the same between the html files but the body class varies depending on a couple of options available.

## Options

By default the off canvas area shows up on the left side of the viewport.

Add "off-canvas-right" class to the body tag for an off canvas area that shows up to the right of the viewport.

Add "site-has-header-fixed" for a fixed header.
